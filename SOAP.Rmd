# Summary on a Page (SOAP): Credit Risk Modeling for Loan Repayment

## Objectives Addressed:

- Developed a predictive model for loan repayment using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM).
- Identified key variables affecting loan default risk.
- Addressed management concerns about explaining loan assessment and accounting for variations over time and between states.

## Key Findings:

### Model Performance
- **New Model vs Old Model**: The new model outperforms the previous one, showing a better ROC curve and higher Gini scores.
  - **Evidence**: ROC curves for the new model bow more towards the top-left corner, indicating higher true positive rates and lower false positive rates.

### Important Variables
- **Interest Rate, Term, Annual Income**: Traditional variables like interest rate and annual income are significant predictors.
- **Home Ownership, Loan Purpose**: Less traditional variables like home ownership status and loan purpose also play a role.
  - **Evidence**: Variables with p-values < 0.05 in the GLM model.

### Management Concerns

#### Explainability
- Each significant variable is clearly interpreted for its effect on loan default risk, aligning with regulatory requirements.

#### Variations Over Time & Location
- Accounting for variations in time and states improves model robustness.
  - **Evidence**: Non-zero variance for random effects in the GLMM model.

## Recommendations:
- **Adopt the New Model**: Given its superior performance and explainability.
- **Consider Time and Location**: Use the GLMM model to account for variations in different time periods and states.
- **Focus on Key Variables**: Prioritize variables like interest rate and annual income in loan assessments.

## Confidence Intervals:
- All assertions are backed by statistical tests, and confidence intervals are provided for each significant variable.

## Takeaway:
Our new credit risk model not only aligns with traditional banking risk factors but also incorporates less traditional ones, offering a nuanced understanding of risk. It's robust, explainable, and ready for deployment.
